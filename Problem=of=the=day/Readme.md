## Subarray Sum Equals K

**Problem**: Given an unsorted array of integers, find the number of subarrays whose sum is equal to a given integer `k`.

**Example**:
```java
Input: arr = [10, 2, -2, -20, 10], k = -10
Output: 3

### ðŸ“Œ Longest Subarray With Maximum Bitwise AND

ðŸ”¹ **Problem Statement**  
You are given an integer array `nums` of size `n`.

- Consider all non-empty subarrays of `nums`.
- Compute the bitwise AND of each subarray.
- Let `k` be the maximum value of all these ANDs.
- Return the length of the longest contiguous subarray whose bitwise AND is exactly `k`.

# ðŸ§® Find Median of a Binary Search Tree (BST)

This repository contains a Java solution for finding the **median of a Binary Search Tree (BST)**.  
It follows the GeeksforGeeks-style definition:

- If number of nodes `n` is **odd**, median = `V((n + 1) / 2)`
- If number of nodes `n` is **even**, median = `V(n / 2)`
  
Here, `V1, V2, V3, â€¦, Vn` represent the BST nodes in **ascending order** (inorder traversal).
